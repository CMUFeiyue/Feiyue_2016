 * Hi!

I went to go get lunch, but at the top of every imageProcessing Class (analysis.java, colorProcessing.java, etc.) 
is a comment detailing which functions from that class should be included. You can find the documentation in labview 
following the links from here: http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/370281AA-01/imaqvision/vision_and_motion_pal/.
 If the class exists in java, please comment it like you've been doing. If it's confusing, leave a note and I'll come back to it. If you get mildly confused, the Operators class should be pretty straightforward. If you get really confused I'll be back in ~20 minutes.

Thanks!
Val
